# LibTorrent Dart Bindings Example

## Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to this example project demonstrating how to create LibTorrent bindings for the Dart language. I hope you find it helpful and informative.

## Requirements

Before diving in, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Ensure libtorrent shared library is installed on your system and recognized by the compiler using the flag `-ltorrent-rasterbar`.
- If you have libtorrent source files in a custom path, update the `wrapper/Makefile` accordingly.
- You'll also need to have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed.

## Makefile

- The `wrapper/Makefile` contains various useful rules to streamline the development process:

1. **debug**: Builds a test binary with gdb flag enabled for testing/debugging process.
2. **run**: Similar to `debug`, but it also runs the binary after building.
3. **build**: This rule is responsible for building the wrapper library: `libwrapper.so` by default.

## Build the Wrapper Library

- To build the wrapper library, execute the following command:

```sh
make build
```

## Run the Example Project

Once you've built the wrapper library, follow these steps to run the example project:

1. Copy the library file `libwrapper.so` into the Dart project directory.
2. Get dart packages

```sh
dart pub get
```

2. Run the project using the following command:

```sh
dart run
```
